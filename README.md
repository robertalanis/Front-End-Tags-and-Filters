# Project Info

This is a simple front-end application that takes data from a mock API of students and allows users to search and filter data that is recieved from the API. Users can view and expand on student grade data, as well as add tags to each student.

Users have the ability to search by first and last name, saved tags, or a combination of the two.

The design for this application is entirely responsive for all screen sizes and was styled using plain CSS and media queries.
